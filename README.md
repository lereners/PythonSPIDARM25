Simple overview of use/purpose.

## Description

The program is meant to allow the user to select an audio file and then generate 6 different graphs based on the audio file that is selected, breaking it down into a plot of the sine wave, three different plots of the time it takes for the sound to lose 60 decibels of noise, a graph of the intensity or spectogram, and a combined plot of the three different RT60 graphs.
